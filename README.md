## Description
This application allows users to respond to prompts in their command line terminal in order to generate the data to populate a readme file template. This reduces the time needed to create these files.

## Installation
Copy the repo to your local directory and run with nodejs in your VS Code integrated terminal.

## Usage
Once the repo is cloned to your local directory, right click on the index.js file and select "Open in Integrated Terminal." This opens the command line terminal. Type "node index" without quotations and press enter. Then simply respond to the prompts to populate the readme file data. Upon completion of the last prompt response you will have a readme file created.
